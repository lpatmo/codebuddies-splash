<p>Use Google Hangouts to:</p>
<ul>
<li> screen share to help each other debug</li>
<li> talk out loud each line of code</li>
<li> work through specific programming exercises</li>
<li> show and tell personal projects</li>
<li> read through a specific chapter of a tutorial with an accountability partner</li>
 <li>help each other get un-stuck on specific issues</li>
</ul>
<p> Hangout times and topics can be proposed by any member and are added to a group calendar.

<h2 id="faq-weekly">Find study partners.</h2>
<p>Members of the groups come from different time zones, diverse experiences with technology, and identify with all spectrums of experience levels: anything from "I'm a complete beginner" to "I use this daily at my job." Study partners help you stay motivated and keep you <strong>accountable</strong> to your technology learning goals. </p>

                     <div class="testimonial col-md-3"> <p>"Virtual hangouts with codebuddies made learning to code much easier and a fun process for me. As a consultant, I am always on the road; so I cannot always go to in person coding sessions or meetups. Learning to code was an extremely frustrating process and I have given up on programming multiple times previously. Now, thanks to Codebuddies, I can attend programming session while I am away from home. Not only that, I can always reach out and ask questions to anyone on the codebuddies listserv and get response pretty quickly. Codebuddies took away all the frustrations and made it very easy for me to learn programming.  </p>

                            "I've been participating in Code Buddies for about five months now and I've seen my skills and motivation to continue learning improve dramatically. The google group conversation helps keep my Javascript practice front of mind; It's hard to let more than a few days pass without learning of a new resource that I want to try out. Going into 2015, I’m really excited to be a part of the Code Buddies community.”

                            "Codebuddies gave me the impetus to work through Marijn Haverbeke's invaluable book, Eloquent JavaScript (I'm still working on it). It also introduced me to a bunch of developers far more experienced than I am, people who have pushed me & encouraged me at times when my confidence flagged. The people who make up Codebuddies are great!"

                    <h2>FAQ</h2>


<div id="faq-what"></div>
<h3>What is CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
<p>We're a community of people learning web development. Learning with others helps us learn faster. The project is free and open-sourced. </p>

<div id="faq-pay"></div>
<h3>Do I need to pay anything to join these communities?</h3>
<p>No. It's free and a safe space. We help each other out.</p>



<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>What's the inspiration behind CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
                <p> The number of resources available online for anyone who wants to learn web development on their own is vast, but it can be quite frustrating for a beginner the first time they set up a development environment, touch the command line, fix a merge conflict in git, miss a semicolon, or find that a section of a tutorial they were following is outdated.</p>
                <p>I know because I've experienced all of these hiccups first-hand.</p>
                <p>What I've discovered since I started learning is that <em>people</em> -- mentors, co-workers, and study partners -- were key to accelerating my learning. But not everyone has access to study partners or mentors/co-workers who can help them.</p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>Who should join these learning communities?</h3>
<p>Anyone can join as long as you have an internet connection! You don't need to <em>be</em> or aspire to be a career programmer. Code literacy is for everyone.</p>

<div id="faq-adv"></div>
<h3>Why do I need study groups if I can just find the answer on Stackoverflow?</h3>
                <p>Accountability partners help you:
                <ol>
                    <li>Stay motivated enough to truly master the tutorial.</li>
                    <li>Get un-stuck faster, because other people know exactly what issue you're running into because they're working on the same tutorial. </li>
                    <li>Take advantage of a safe environment where you can ask questions you might hesitate to ask in a public forum.</li>
                    <li>Make connections and exchange helpful tips knowledge with peers who understand your background and skill level.</li>
                    <li>Validate your understanding of the material when you find yourself explaining concepts to others running into the same questions you once ran into. (The open-source community has a culture of being quite collaborative: get help, and helps others in turn!)</li></p>
                </ol>
                </p>

<div id="faq-hangout-tips"></div>
<h3>How can Google Hangouts be used most effectively for learning HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python, etc.?</h3>
                <p>Some general hangout tips:
                <ol>
                    <li>You don't need to turn on video. Use audio to questions freely.</li>
                    <li>Share screens to keep yourself focused and to make it easier to follow your study partners' progress.  </li>
                    <li>To share your screen, clickicon on the left sidebar of the hangout, and then click on the first screen that appears inside the module. Your hangout partners would then be able to click on your icon to see your workflow, and then help you identify your problem much more easily. </li>
                    <li>Google Hangout lets all participants share their screens simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Share helpful Stackoverflow links with each other in the chat window.</li>
                    <li> If you found the hangout productive, schedule the next time to meet so you can keep the productive momentum going.</li></p>
                </ol>
