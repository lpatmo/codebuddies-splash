<p>Hey all! This week I finally launched our company&#39;s game making courses in NYC. It&#39;s been a long road, but we hope to get our space up in the New Year and have the best place for exploring, building and thinking about the next generation of play. It&#39;s called PlayWell.<br />
<br />
We&#39;re actually offering huge New Year&#39;s discounts for some upcoming workshops too and I figured this crowd might be interested. <a href="http://playwell.co" target="_blank">playwell.co</a> If you want to learn Unity engine or some basic game design concepts and build your own games in a weekend, check it out. If you sign up, mention CodeBuddies and I&#39;ll send you a discount code for 15% off. Would love to meet some NYC CodeBuddies members!</p>

<h2>Something I Learned</h2>
<em>No matter how small!</em>

<hr />
<p>This week I learned what CRUD stood for, and that it&#39;s actually just a way to refer to the stuff you do in SQL rather than some mysterious technology:)</p>

<hr />
<p>This week I finally understood what scopes and closures are all about! :D<br />
