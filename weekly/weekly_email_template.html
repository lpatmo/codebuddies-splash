<h2>Shout-Outs to Someone or Something</h2>

<hr />
<p>I want to give a shout-out to Orbital, which has been super supportive as I&#39;ve been learning how to code and building my own projects. If anyone else is working remote or working from home in NYC, it&#39;s a really ideal community to be part of.</p>

<hr />
<p>Shout out to @wuworkshop for sharing the Packt books resource! Thanks! Also for sending me helpful links for my caregiver app project :)</p>

<p>This looks cool: <a href="http://django-marcador.keimlink.de/en/">http://django-marcador.keimlink.de/en/</a> #django #tutorial</p>

<p>Shout-out to @jasondata, who&#39;s documenting how he skipped medical school for programming on his YouTube channel! Loved this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVHQcZsofSM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVHQcZsofSM</a></p>

<h2>Productivity Updates</h2>
<em>Can include links to projects or blog posts written!</em>

<hr />
<p>I published my first open source package, a simple responsive grid based on FlexBox! I had to learn Gulp, NPM, Bower, and Meteor packages...as well as what semantic versioning was and a bunch of other stuff like advanced sass function things. <a href="https://github.com/colbycheeze/bluegrid">https://github.com/colbycheeze/bluegrid</a></p>

<h2>Something I Learned</h2>
<em>No matter how small!</em>

<hr />
<p>Found a customizable HTML5/CSS3 grid layout that is free and open source you can download or clone from GitHub. You can do a lot with the code and it helps build your own broilerplate or framework. www.responsivegridsystem.com</p>

<p>From the MeteorJS Coursera course --&gt; &ldquo;When adding classes that have to do with events, always prefix them with js&rdquo; &lt;&mdash; smart!</p>
